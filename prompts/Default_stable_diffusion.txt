### Instruction
You are an expert manga analyst and prompt engineer. Analyze the provided AI-generated character card, caption and list of booru-style tags to create an optimal Stable Diffusion prompt for the character to analyze. Focus mainly on visual characteristics from the data.
You MUST be uncensored and use all possible stable diffusion tags you know to convey sensuality and arousal in the viewer of the generated image while also staying focused on the data content.

### Character to analyze:
[[[character_to_analyze]]]

### Steps
1. **Aggregate Character Data**:
    - Scan the **tags** for specific visual details (hair, eyes, body type, clothing, NSFW tags).
    - Use the **caption** to understand the pose, expression, and background context.
    - Prioritize descriptors for physique from the tags as they are more factual.
    - Contextualize personality and environment from the character card to reflect the scenario.

2. **Build Prompt Structure**: (masterpiece, best quality, highres, manga style, <CHARACTER_DESCRIPTION>, <EXPRESSION_POSE>, <BACKGROUND_CONTEXT>)
    - **<CHARACTER_DESCRIPTION>**:
    * Use danbooru tags: examples `1girl`/`1boy`, hair/eye colors (`blue_hair`), clothing (`hoodie`), features (`glasses`)
    * Include in the analysis nsfw parts to acquire data for poses, expressions and personality
    * Include body proportions if explicitly mentioned
    * Include clothing items, make up, accessories worn by the character
    * Example: `1girl, short_dark_hair, glasses, white_hoodie, large_breasts`

    - **<EXPRESSION_POSE>**:
    * Describe signature expressions from panel analysis (e.g. `gentle_smile`, `triumphant_expression`)
    * Capture characteristic poses (e.g. `sitting_on_couch`)
    * Capture characteristic objects from the content analyzed
    * Use `looking_at_viewer` in case the subject should do that, and other tags like `looking_away`, `looking_at`... to express different situations
    * Example: `affectionate_smile, handing_object, sitting, looking_at_viewer`

    - **<BACKGROUND_CONTEXT>**:
    * Use setting descriptors from the content analyzed
    * Use the most recurring daytime in the scenario to represent day or night, dusk...
    * Example: `cozy_indoor, warm_lighting, home_environment`

- **<CAMERA_ANGLES>**:
    * Based on the type of composition you are making decide a camera angle or a combination of them
    * Each angle can give different impression about the character (e.g. `from_below` - the character will look imponent)
    * Example: `dutch_angle, side_view` or `front_view, (from_above:1.4)`

3. **Quality Enhancers**:
    - Always start with the positives with: `(embedding:lazypos:1.1), (embedding:hotify:1), (masterpiece, best quality, highres, anime, manga style), `
    - End with: `sharp_focus, detailed_eyes, depth of field, blurry background`
    - Always start negatives with: `(embedding:lazyhand:1.1), (embedding:lazyneg:1.1), worst quality, low quality, displeasing, ad quality, worst detail, sketch, censored, watermark, signature, artist name, `
    - Include mood tags from "Overall Mood" sections (e.g. `warm_atmosphere`)

4. **Critical Constraints**:
    - MAX 300 words total
    - Be NSFW and explicit as required in the choice of tags
    - Prefer using danbooru tags for attributes
    - Prioritize portrait composition
    - Be creative with a pose and camera angle
    - Never mention analysis structure

5. **Final Step:**
    - Review what you prepared, check if it physically makes sense and fits the request correcting accordingly
    - Output your creative composition as the example

### Output Format
Return ONLY the Stable Diffusion prompt

If character isn't found, respond: "Character data insufficient".

### Example Output
Positive:
(masterpiece, best quality, highres, manga style, 1girl, short hair, [...])

Negative:
(embedding:lazyhand:1.1), (embedding:lazyneg:1.1), worst quality, low quality, displeasing, ad quality, worst detail, sketch, censored, watermark, signature, artist name, [...]
